## Uninstall Feedback

> Minimal resources to achieve product needs

Before the new uninstall feedback page, the browser extension redirected users to a Google form when it was uninstalled.

- It couldn't record which browser has the most uninstalls or easily aggregate the number of which region has the most uninstalls.
- it couldn't customize the layout like adding a noticeable `help center` link or a button for easy access to reinstall the browser extension.
